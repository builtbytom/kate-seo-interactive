                    <p>A 44 performance score is rough. Google uses site speed as a ranking factor, and slow sites lose customers. When someone clicks your result and it takes forever to load, they bounce back to Google - which hurts your rankings even more.</p>

                            <p>Your homepage content needs to naturally include the keywords people search for. Right now, Google doesn't see clear connections between your site and terms like "haircut" or "hair salon North Haven." Here's an example of how to work those terms in naturally:</p>
                            <div class="content-box">
                                <p>"Welcome to Salon Space, where our talented stylists create beautiful hair transformations in a relaxing environment. From precision cuts to vibrant color, we specialize in bringing your vision to life. Located in North Haven, we're passionate about making every client look and feel their absolute best."</p>
                            </div>
                            <p><strong>Word this in your own voice,</strong> but notice how it naturally includes "cuts," your location, and what you do without sounding robotic. The goal is to help Google understand what you offer while sounding like a real business, not a keyword machine.</p>

                        <li><strong>Meta Description:</strong> Same place, look for "Page Description"</li>
                        <li><strong>Homepage Content:</strong> Edit your main page and replace the first paragraph</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>If you get stuck or just don't want to mess with it, I'm happy to handle these updates for you.
